# Intro to Flask

> In the past few days, been frustrated with how Miguel makes Flask look complex when it shouldn't be. I've decided to put together my own series of Getting Started with Flask, and keeping it simple and stupid. Looking forward to your contribution!

The aim of this intro is to serve as soft starting point for any beginner who just started Python the other day, and has finally learnt some CSS and HTML and would like to put together a simple full-stack app.

### How to Contribute
- You can suggest additional stuff that needs to be covered
- You can call out places where I've put unnecessary complexity, whereas I would have just KISS'd it.
- Fork the repo, do some stuff and send me a PR, I'll appreciate.
